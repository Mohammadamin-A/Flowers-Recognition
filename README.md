# Flowers-Recognition

Deep Learning Project:

This repository contains my first deep learning project, which was built using a Kaggle dataset and trained on Google Colab. The project includes a Jupyter notebook file (Flowers_Recognition.ipynb) that contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, and testing, as well as a README file (README.md) to provide an overview of the project.

Dataset:

The dataset used in this project for Flower Recognition can be found at [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition] on Kaggle. It includes 4242 images of flowers collected from Flickr, Google Images, and Yandex Images. The images are categorized into five classes: chamomile, tulip, rose, sunflower, and dandelion. This dataset was used to train and test a neural network model that can recognize plants from photos.

Instructions:

To run this project on your own machine, you can clone this repository and open the project.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. Make sure that you have the necessary dependencies installed before running the code.

ChatGPT is used during debugging process.
